PROJECT: Interactive Portfolio Website with Blob Cursor Reveal Effect

===== PHASE 1: IMAGE GENERATION =====

Generate two identical portraits of a girl with the exact same pose, positioning, and framing:

Image 1: Girl wearing a plain black t-shirt who seems to work in corporate. Use provided reference photo.

Image 2: Girl wearing Nepali traditional clothing with her hair braided.

Both images must have:
- Centered composition
- Head and shoulders directly facing camera at eye level
- Eyes looking straight ahead
- Neutral expression
- Framed from top of head to upper chest just below shoulders
- Same exact head tilt and body angle
- Professional studio lighting from the front
- Sharp focus
- Photorealistic
- Solid white background
- Passport photo style
- High resolution 4K quality
- Positioning must be pixel-perfect identical so images can be overlaid perfectly


===== PHASE 2: WEBSITE DEVELOPMENT =====

LAYOUT:
- Full-screen hero section using [BLACK T-SHIRT IMAGE] as the background
- "SANS" and "LAMSAL" stacked vertically in the top left corner, in black
- "PROJECTS" button in the top right - simple text, black color
- Bottom right corner: social media icons for Instagram, X, YouTube, and LinkedIn as solid black icons with links

THE INTERACTIVE ELEMENT:
- Create a blob cursor effect that follows the mouse around
- The blob should feel smooth and organic with a subtle delay as it trails behind the cursor
- This blob acts like a window that reveals [NEPALI TRADITIONAL CLOTHING IMAGE] underneath
- As users move their cursor, they unveil the version with traditional clothing
- When cursor moves faster, add smaller blobs (3-5) that trail behind creating a tail effect with fading shapes

CURSOR SPECIFICATIONS:
- Shape: Organic flowery/petal shape (NOT circular, NOT morphing)
- Size: Large (approximately 320px)
- Movement: Smooth with minimal delay, responsive feel
- Should maintain consistent flower form (no shape morphing)
- Trailing blobs follow with fade effect

INTERACTION DETAILS:
- When blob hovers over any text (name, button, or social icons), those elements turn white for readability
- All transitions use 300ms timing for smoothness
- Blob reveal must line up perfectly with both images - zero misalignment when traditional clothing version shows through

TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS:
- Both images must be perfectly aligned for seamless reveal effect
- Custom cursor replaces default cursor
- Smooth, organic movement with easing
- Professional, polished execution
